## Introduction

The MusicApp is an ASP.NET application that leverages the Entity Framework Core for data access. It follows a Code First approach to define the data model, and the application is structured to manage information about artists, including their names, genres, and other details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:AyeshaSeemab93/MusicApp-ASP.NET.git
   ```

2. Open the solution in  Visual Studio Code.

3. Build the solution:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a standard ASP.NET MVC pattern. Key folders include:

- **Controllers**: Contains the controller classes responsible for handling HTTP requests.
- **Models**: Defines the entity classes representing the data model.
- **Repositories**: Implements data access logic, including the repository pattern.
- **Services**: Encapsulates business logic and operations on entities.
- **Data**: Contains the database context class (`AppDbContext`).
Certainly, let's dive deeper into the components and processes involved in the MusicApp. I'll provide more details on key elements in the code.

### 1. **Controllers:**
Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and manage the flow of data between the Model and the View. In the MusicApp, controllers are responsible for defining API endpoints and processing requests related to artists.

### 2. **Models:**
Models represent the entities in your application. In the MusicApp, the primary model is the `Artist` class, which contains properties like `Id`, `Name`, and `Genre`. These models are used to define the structure of your database tables.

### 3. **Repositories:**
Repositories encapsulate the logic for data access. In the MusicApp, the `ArtistRepository` class interacts with the database using Entity Framework Core. It contains methods such as `GetAllArtistsAsync`, `GetArtistByIdAsync`, etc., which perform CRUD operations on the `Artists` table.

### 4. **Services:**
Services contain business logic and coordinate actions between repositories and controllers. In the MusicApp, the `ArtistService` class might not be explicitly defined in the provided code, but it's a common pattern to have services for more complex business logic, validations, or coordination between different parts of the application.

### 5. **DbContext (Data):**
The `AppDbContext` class represents the database context and is responsible for connecting to the database and coordinating with Entity Framework Core. It includes a `DbSet` property for each entity (e.g., `Artists`). The connection string for the database is typically specified in the `appsettings.json` file.

### 6. **Database Migrations:**
Entity Framework Core uses migrations to version-control the database schema. Migrations are generated and applied based on changes to the data model. The `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate` command is used to create a migration, and `dotnet ef database update` applies the migrations to the database.

### 7. **Swagger Documentation:**
Swagger is a tool for documenting and testing APIs. In the MusicApp, Swagger is integrated to provide interactive documentation for the API. The `SwaggerGen` package is often used to generate the Swagger documentation based on the API controllers and models. The Swagger UI is accessible at `http://localhost:5171/swagger/index.html` and allows developers to explore and test the API endpoints.

### 8. **Dependency Injection:**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve loose coupling and promote testability. In the MusicApp, dependencies such as the `AppDbContext` are injected into the constructor of classes like `ArtistRepository`. DI is configured in the `Startup.cs` file.

### 9. **Async/Await Pattern:**
The use of `async` and `await` keywords indicates the use of asynchronous programming. Async operations are used to avoid blocking the main thread, especially when performing I/O-bound operations like database queries. Asynchronous methods typically return `Task` or `Task<T>`.

### 10. **Configuration (appsettings.json):**
The `appsettings.json` file contains configuration settings for the application, including the connection string for the database. Configuration settings are accessed in the application code, providing a way to change behavior without modifying code.


## Database Configuration

The application uses Entity Framework Core for data access. The connection string is configured in the `appsettings.json` file.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "database_connection_string"
  }
}
```

### 11. **Running the Application:**

Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
dotnet run 
```
The command `dotnet run --project MusicApp` is used to run the application. This starts the web server, and the application becomes accessible at `http://localhost:5171/swagger/index.html`.

These components collectively create a web application that manages artist information in a music database. It follows best practices such as separation of concerns, dependency injection, and asynchronous programming to build a scalable and maintainable application.


## Swagger Documentation

Swagger documentation is available to explore and test the API endpoints. After starting the application, navigate to [http://localhost:5171/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:5171/swagger/index.html) in your browser.
